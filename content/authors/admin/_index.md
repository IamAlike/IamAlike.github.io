Previous Positions and Work Experience:
  Academic Positions:
    The research activities were mainly carried out on computer science-related topics both when he was a student and researcher in Iran and Italy. During his past research, he was more focused on the application of mathematics and specifically the optimization techniques for solving real-world problems including localization and data processing. With the rapid extension of data-driven decision-making and artificial intelligence, he also started to work in this direction, using machine learning algorithms and techniques for many applications including localization, human activity recognition, handling missing data, occupancy detection, and vehicle routing problems. The results of these researchers are mainly the papers both in journals and international conferences and some books. Working with different groups in research helped him to understand better how to combine real-world problems into academic solutions. Currently, he has started using machine learning for a new topic on explainable AI and integrating the domain knowledge by into neural networks. The research activities are mainly based on Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Informed networks, Optimization (centralized and distributed), and Localization.
